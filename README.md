### Hi there 👋
## Welcome to my profile, 
# I'm Abdrahman Oladimeji

I'm a front-end engineer, speaker, and community manager. I specialize in creating seamless, high-performance web and mobile applications. With a passion for modern JavaScript/Typescript frameworks, I build interactive experiences using React, Next.js, and React Native.

- 🔧 I've worked on several projects where I focus on enhancing user interfaces and improving frontend architectures.

- 🌱 I’m always learning new things; currently, I’m diving deeper into server-side rendering with Next.js and advanced features in react native hoping to apply them in building complex apps.

- 👥 I'm keen to collaborate on ambitious projects that are poised to change the way we interact with technology. If you’re working on something exciting, I’d love to contribute!

- 💬 Ask me about frontend development, best practices in React, Next and React Native, or any tech-related stuff. I’m here to help and learn together!

- 📫 How to reach me: [Send me DM on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rahmlad) or a [Mail](mailto:abdrahmanoladimeji02@gmail.com)
